Hello and welcome to The History of Rome.

00:00:06:01 --> 00:00:10:01
The founding of Rome is an event wrapped in myth, 

00:00:10:01 --> 00:00:16:01
lacking a credible historical record, it is impossible to know exactly what led to the establishment of the Eternal City.

00:00:16:01 --> 00:00:19:05
But we do know the legend the Romans told themselves

00:00:19:05 --> 00:00:24:05
and have some idea of the population migrations that took place in central Italy at the time,

00:00:24:05 --> 00:00:28:05
so we can piece together a general timeline of events.

00:00:28:05 --> 00:00:31:15
There may be truth wrapped up in the official legend and there may not.

00:00:31:15 --> 00:00:36:15
But it is a good story and an important one to know for students of ancient history.

00:00:36:15 --> 00:00:45:13
It is the story of a refugee trojan prince and how his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, 

00:00:45:13 --> 00:00:54:07
great, great great great great grandsons would be wet-nursed by a she-wolf and later found the greatest city of the ancient world.

00:00:54:07 --> 00:01:02:12
The story of Rome begins with the end of the Trojan War. After Troy was finally sacked by the Greeks, Aeneas chief lieutenant of Hector

00:01:02:12 --> 00:01:08:23
managed to escape with a few followers. They boarded ships and set out into the Mediterranean to find a new home.

00:01:09:23 --> 00:01:18:03
Their odyssey took them from Asia Minor to the north coast of Africa, where a nurse managed to sow the seeds of the three Punic Wars by seducing

00:01:18:03 --> 00:01:28:14
the Carthaginian queen Dido and then abandoning her. Virgil writes that in the final moments before she committed suicide, Dido curse the descendant of both to eternal enmity.

00:01:29:17 --> 00:01:37:02
Oh my tyrion's seeds with hate, his progeny and all his race to come. Make this your offering to my dust.

00:01:37:02 --> 00:01:47:07
No love, no pact must be between our peoples. No, but rise up from my bones avenging spirit. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

00:01:48:17 --> 00:01:56:17
After securing an archenemy for Rome, a near sail to the west coast of Italy, where he and his followers hope to make a settlement.

00:01:56:17 --> 00:02:02:22
Arriving in the territory of Lorensen, the Trojans were immediately met by armed locals who tried to drive them off.

00:02:04:00 --> 00:02:13:09
But their king Latin decided to make peace rather than war with the foreigners and offered his daughter Lavinia to a nurse, solidifying an alliance.

00:02:13:09 --> 00:02:20:13
This marriage came as quite a shock to Turness prince if there were truly a nearby tribe because Lavinia had already been pledged to him.

00:02:21:10 --> 00:02:28:05
Angered by the slap in the face, he led an attack on the combined Trojan and Latin forces there truly were defeated.

00:02:28:05 --> 00:02:38:00
But king flatness was killed in the fighting, leaving Aeneas in control of both the Trojans and the Latins, who are rapidly intermarrying into a single people vanquished.

00:02:38:04 --> 00:02:49:07
Turness and there are truly turn north to the rich and powerful Etruscans for help. The Etruscans were more than willing to lend a hand against the growing menace of the Trojan infused Latins and attacked.

00:02:49:07 --> 00:02:57:02
But Aeneas, in his final act, led the Latins to victory, establishing the Tiber River as the boundary between the Latins and the Etruscans

00:02:58:08 --> 00:03:04:12
, which are part of the legend here. Before we get too far and give an account of the political landscape of Rome in Italy.

00:03:04:12 --> 00:03:13:06
As historians and archeologists understand it today, who were the Latins? Who were the Etruscans? Where did they come from and what sort of lives did they lead?

00:03:14:20 --> 00:03:24:06
The origin of the Etruscans is debatable. However, DNA evidence points to a migration from Asia Minor, which, if true, offers a context for the legend

00:03:24:06 --> 00:03:34:15
of a nurse's arrival from Troy. The Etruscans were the dominant force culturally and politically in the Italian peninsula, and, as we will see, came to dominate

00:03:34:15 --> 00:03:42:22
Latin territory in the waning years of the Roman Kingdom. They had developed cities and a confederal state system long before the Latins, who remained

00:03:42:22 --> 00:03:50:04
in traditional tribal affiliations until the Foundation of Rome, which was the first major settlement in Latin territory that could be called a city.

00:03:51:05 --> 00:03:57:18
The Etruscans were artists and craftsmen who had set up extensive trading networks that reached all the way to Greece.

00:03:57:18 --> 00:04:06:23
The trading roads between Etruria and the Greek cities of Magna Gratia in the South ran right through Rome, offering a clue as to the reason for its location.

00:04:08:16 --> 00:04:16:23
The Latins, in contrast, were simple pastoral herdsmen. Evidence from ancient burial mounds suggests the Latins were descended from Balkan

00:04:16:23 --> 00:04:24:15
migrants who crossed the Adriatic and pre-history mostly shepherds and farmers. They did not have any sort of advanced arts or crafts.

00:04:25:06 --> 00:04:31:23
What culture they display seems to be little more than a blend of Etruscan and Greek elements. Indeed, nothing about later.

00:04:31:23 --> 00:04:42:23
Roman history suggests the Latins were innovative at all in art, religion or letters. They excelled at warfare and engineering and administrating, but were merely students of philosophy.

00:04:43:03 --> 00:04:50:16
Never instructors their gods to take one obvious example are little more than an adaptation of the Greek pantheon.

00:04:50:16 --> 00:05:02:04
Zoos becoming Jupiter, Hara, becoming Juno and so forth were bound. The Latins together was a common language distinct from the Etruscan language to the North and the imported Greek in the south.

00:05:03:10 --> 00:05:11:04
Latin, of course, forms the basis for half the languages in Europe, and its vocabulary still dominates the legal profession.

00:05:11:04 --> 00:05:19:11
But enough humor, less anthropology. After a niece died, his young son, Scania, grew to be king. The town built by the Trojan settlers,

00:05:19:11 --> 00:05:27:07
had become too small for the exploding population at a skinniest led a group east to found a new settlement called Alba Longa, which would become

00:05:27:07 --> 00:05:34:23
the seat of the growing Latin kingdom. Generation upon generation followed and the Latins became powerful and secure.

00:05:34:23 --> 00:05:42:02
The kingship was passed from father to son until finally arrested upon the head of a man named New Mature Newt Matar had a brother

00:05:42:02 --> 00:05:48:21
named Emilia's who coveted the throne and decided to seize power for himself. New Matar was driven from Alba Alvarenga.

00:05:48:21 --> 00:05:57:01
All his sons were killed and his daughter, Rey Sylvia, was forced to become a Vestal virgin to ensure she would bear no children who could threaten the West.

00:05:57:20 --> 00:06:06:08
However, after taking the vows, Ray was the victim of rape and consequently gave birth to twin boys. Ray declared that the God Mars was the father,

00:06:06:08 --> 00:06:15:15
but to no avail, and for the crime of allowing herself to be raped, she was thrown in prison. The twins were sent to be drowned in the Tiber.

00:06:15:15 --> 00:06:23:18
However, the men entrusted with the task found the river flooded and left the boys in the sluggish water rather than slogging their way to the river itself.

00:06:23:18 --> 00:06:32:16
And when the waters receded, the babies were left alive and well in the reeds here. Legend states that she was coming to the river to quench your thirst,

00:06:32:16 --> 00:06:39:17
found the babies and offered her teach for them to suckle on. A herdsman came upon the scene and gathered the children up from the wolf,

00:06:39:17 --> 00:06:42:05
who had been gently licking them and took them home with him.

00:06:43:04 --> 00:06:52:24
Even Levi acknowledges that the story of the wolf is a fable and postulates that it may have arisen because the herdsmen's wife was a whore named Wolf.

00:06:52:24 --> 00:06:58:16
The herdsman and his wife raised the boys, named Romulus and Remus as their own, and soon they grew to be men.

00:06:59:17 --> 00:07:06:08
Apparently, the boys took a liking to fighting the local Brigham's, who raided the countryside and began taking the fight to the robbers,

00:07:06:08 --> 00:07:12:20
raiding their camps and stealing from them. The criminals, angered by the theft of their booty, set a trap for the twins.

00:07:13:12 --> 00:07:20:04
Romulus managed to escape, but Remus was captured. The Bergen's took Remus to the local landowner, who turned out to be none

00:07:20:04 --> 00:07:26:22
other than the exiled new mataura and claimed Ramazan his brother had been caught stealing numerous cattle and that he should be punished.

00:07:28:00 --> 00:07:35:14
New mataura was immediately reminded of his twin grandsons and realizing that they would be the same age as Remus was now, began to suspect

00:07:35:14 --> 00:07:44:12
that the boys were his blood. New Mature began making inquiries and soon learned the particulars of their upbringing and became convinced that they were his daughter's children.

00:07:45:09 --> 00:07:53:20
The herdsman, knowing Ramos, was in numerous custody and having himself long suspected that his two boys were of royal blood, decided to tell Romulus

00:07:53:20 --> 00:08:03:04
the whole story of their discovery by the river from this plan was hatched to return new mataura to the throne, with Romulus leading one group of men and Remus another.

00:08:03:10 --> 00:08:11:22
They surprised and killed them, Julius, and brought new Mata back to all longa new. Mata told the story of his brother's treachery and the circumstances

00:08:11:22 --> 00:08:19:23
of his grandson's birth, and the people shouted unanimous consent. The new mataura became once again after new mataura became king.

00:08:20:04 --> 00:08:28:11
Romulus and Remus decided to found a new settlement at the spot where they had been left to drown. There are two accounts of what happened next.

00:08:28:11 --> 00:08:32:22
one states that trouble arose when the question of who would be senior in the new city was raised.

00:08:33:15 --> 00:08:42:11
They decided to allow the gods to decide and each retired to the top of a hill romulus the power time and remits the Argentine to a way to sign.

00:08:42:11 --> 00:08:50:07
Soon enough, six vultures landed at the feet of Remus, and when his followers made this known to Romulus, twelve vultures immediately landed at Romulus feet.

00:08:51:07 --> 00:09:00:01
A fight broke out, with one side claiming primacy of arrival and the other claiming primacy of no. In this fight, Remus was killed.

00:09:00:01 --> 00:09:07:22
The other more famous story is that Remus, mocking his brother, jumped over the partially completed walls and Romulus in a fit of anger, killed him.

00:09:08:03 --> 00:09:17:12
Wearing so perish, whoever shall over, leave my battlements. Either way, Romulus obtained sole power. The city was named for him and he became its first king.

00:09:17:12 --> 00:09:31:09
The legendary data foundation is April the 21st 753 B.C. That it happened like this, almost certainly not after the sack of Rome and 386 B.C. most of the early historical record was

00:09:31:09 --> 00:09:39:24
lost and with it, the specifics we need for an accurate telling of the story. But archeological evidence seems to support the broader strokes of the legend.

00:09:39:24 --> 00:09:47:02
Settlements have been found on the Palatine Hill, the date from the 800 B.C., suggesting that the legendary chronology is at least in the ballpark.

00:09:47:21 --> 00:09:56:05
The general story of struggle between the Latin and Etruscan people, ending with ostensible Latin autonomy South Tiber also fits our understanding

00:09:56:05 --> 00:10:04:13
of the ethnic and cultural landscape of the era. It is doubtful that the site of Rome was chosen because it marked where the twins had been sent to die.

00:10:05:02 --> 00:10:11:21
More likely, an easy river crossing, coupled with the natural defenses offered by the nearby hills, drew settlers to the area.

00:10:11:21 --> 00:10:20:14
And of course, as already noted, the site lay on the trade road between Etruria and Magna Grecia. Without any real data to draw from.

00:10:20:21 --> 00:10:29:03
Later, Roman historians use common mythological elements to construct a conventional founding legend in a European culture produced numerous examples

00:10:29:03 --> 00:10:38:06
of the divine twin missing, including Castor and Pollux and Itis and winter years of Thebes. The motif of infant exposure gone wrong crops up in the biographies

00:10:38:06 --> 00:10:47:24
of both Perseus and Moses, and of course, most will recognize the Virgin birth element from Christianity. But tales of miraculous virgin births have surrounded

00:10:47:24 --> 00:10:57:12
important legendary and historical figures for Millennium. The addition of Aeneas gives Rome a lofty ancestor and connects their city to the Greek civilizations.

00:10:57:12 --> 00:11:04:03
The Romans so admired, however, it happened. A settlement was established at the bend in the Tiber.

00:11:04:03 --> 00:11:12:15
This settlement grew and came to dominate its neighboring communities. Then the entire Italian peninsula, then the entire Mediterranean.

00:11:12:15 --> 00:11:20:11
Next, we will cover Rome's unsavory beginnings, who the first Romans were, whose women they stole to ensure that there would be a second generation

00:11:20:11 --> 00:11:25:24
of Romans, and whether Romulus grade soldier that he was died or simply faded away.
